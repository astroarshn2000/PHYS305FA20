    "# Exercise: The damped Pendulum\n",
    "adapted from lecture notes by Phil Pinto, and notebooks by Jonas Tjemsland, Eilif Sommer Øyre and Jon Andreas Støvneng.\n",
    "## The simple Pendulum\n",
    "We will first discuss the *simple pendulum* which is a simple and idealised model of the real pendulum. It consists of a point mass $m$ suspended by an unstretchable, massless string (or rod) of length $l$. The pendulum only moves in one plane and there is no friction. Let $\\theta$ denote the angle between the vertical axis and the string, such that $\\theta=0$ at equilibrium. Note that the position of the pendulum can be specified using only $\\theta$. If we pull the mass to one side and let it go, it will start to to oscillate around the equilibrium, similar to a wrecking ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two forces acting on the mass: the gravitaional force $\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{g}$ and the pull from the string $\\mathbf{S}$. The forces can be decomposed into a direction along the string (radial direction, $\\hat r$) and a direction along the path of the point mass (azimuthal direction, $\\hat \\theta$). Since the string is assumed to be unstretchable, only the gravitational pull in the azimuthal direction, $\\mathbf F_\\theta$, will contribute to the motion of the pendulum. The gravitational force in the radial direction, $\\mathbf F_r$, is cancelled by the pull from the string: $\\mathbf F_r = - \\mathbf{S}$. Henceis clear that\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "F_\\theta = -mg\\sin\\theta.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now use Newton's second law, $\\mathbf{F}=m\\mathbf{a}$, to find an differential equation describing the motion of the pendulum. Let $t$ denote the time. The acceleration of the point mass can be expressed by\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",

    "### Analytical Approximation\n",
    "Equation (\\ref{simplependODE}) cannot be solved analytically. However, note that $\\sin\\theta\\approx \\theta$ for $\\theta \\ll 1$. Thus, for small angles, the motion can be approximated by\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\theta_0$ is the initial posision at time $t=0$. This is known as a harmonic oscillation. The period of the oscillation is $T=2\\pi/\\omega_0=2\\pi\\sqrt{l/g}$.\n",

    "### Numerical Solution\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\"> Introduce the angular velocity $\\omega = \\frac{d\\theta}{d t}$ and rewrite Equation (\\ref{simplependODE}) into a system of two coupled first-order ODEs, and complete the function `simple_pendulum_RHS` that provides an expression for the right hand side of this system of linear ODES. </span>\n",
