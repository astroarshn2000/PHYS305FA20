# PHYS 305 - Computational Physics (Fall '20)

**Instructor: Prof. Elisabeth Krause (UArizona)** 

**Code Author: Arsh Nadkarni (UArizona)**

PHYS 305 is a course for students of Physical Sciences that introduces basic computational methods for solving mathematical problems motivated from the physical sciences. Often problems drawn from actual physics will form the basis for the examples that will serve to master the techniques and algorithms taught.

**Topics Covered:**
* Introduction to the Python Language
* Numerical Solution of Linear and Non-Linear Algebraic Equations
* Interpolation
* Numerical Differentiation and Integration of Arbitrary Functions
* Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
* Solution of Boundary Value Problems for ODEs
* Solution of Hyperbolic, Parabolic, and Elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
* Markov Chain - Monte Carlo (MCMC)
* Basic Machine Learning Algorithms   
* Basic Introduction to the C Programming Language
