    "### Answer\n",
    "In this problem, not only did you need to implement Romberg integration, you also needed to figure out how to deal with the singularity at the origin and the infinite limits of integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with the singularity, we can use l'Hopital's rule to show that the limit of the integrand at x=0 is zero: setting $f(x) = x^3$ and $g(x) = e^x-1$\n",
    "$$ \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{3x^2}{e^x} = 0$$\n",
    "converges, hence $$\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=0\\,,$$\n",
    "hence I made the function `planck(x)` return 0 if $x=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More interesting are the limits of integration. Two sources of error affect the result of your\n",
    "calculation. The first is the truncation error left after Richardson extrapolation. The second is the value of the remaining integral from some finite $x_{max}$ to $\\infty$.  Because the integrand decreases relatively rapidly with $x$, we clearly don't need to go to too large an upper limit of integration before the remaining integral becomes negligibly small. To show this, I not only used Romberg integration to evaluate the integral as requested, I also used it to evaluate the error from not completing the integration to $\\infty$.  Since this is only one of two errors, as long as this \"remainder integral\" is rather smaller than the estimate of the error from Richardson extrapolation, we have an acceptable value for $x_{max}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to push things to the breaking point, I asked for 13 digits of relative accuracy. I found that $x_{max}=70$ gave the best answer, but this is clearly fortuitous since the remaining integral at this point is in the 24-th decimal place! Asking for 13 digits of accuracy with only 14 digits of precision in each arithmetic step is clearly asking too much. "
